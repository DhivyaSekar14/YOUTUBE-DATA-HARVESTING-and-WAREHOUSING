# YOUTUBE-DATA-HARVESTING-and-WAREHOUSING
YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING and WAREHOUSING using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

**Overview:**

This project aims to collect and warehouse YouTube data using a combination of SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit. The goal is to provide a robust and efficient system for harvesting, storing, and visualizing YouTube-related information.

**Features:**

YouTube Data Harvesting: Utilize the YouTube API to fetch relevant data, including video details, comments, likes, and other metadata.

SQL Database: Use SQL for structured data storage. Store information such as video details, user information, and engagement metrics in a relational database.

MongoDB: Leverage MongoDB for unstructured data storage. Store comments, tags, and other non-tabular data in a flexible and scalable NoSQL database.

Streamlit Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard using Streamlit for data visualization and exploration. Enable users to interact with the data easily.

**Prerequisites:**
Before running the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. MongoDB
3. SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
4. YouTube API Key
